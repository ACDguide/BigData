# Working Group Goals

## Goal:
**Create a best practices framework for climate-related scientists in Australia working with big/challenging datasets.**

### Definition of terms: 
**“Big/challenging data”:** when the size and complexity of the dataset is such that “traditional data-processing application software” is inadequate to handle the analysis or management of the dataset (Wikipedia page for “Big data”; more specifics can also be found at Pangeo FAQ: https://pangeo.io/faq.html)

### Steps to achieve our goal:
- Consolidate a list of software, tools, learning/training modules, relevant documentation, and other resources that currently exist for dealing with, specifically for storing, accessing, and analyzing, big data.
- Identify weak points/missing gaps in existing resources
- Expand documentation, create learning modules, etc. to fill the identified gaps in currently available resources
- Communicate with other working groups (e.g. on data management guidelines) on issues related to improving data organization

### Working group full name: 
“Working with big/challenging data collections”

### Short name: 
“Big data”
