# Identifying which languages/tools are best suited to specific tasks


This page contains:
- [Python](#python)
- [R](#r)
- [MATLAB](#matlab)
- [NCO](#nco-netcdf-operators)
- [CDO](#cdo-climate-data-operators)

Other languages and tools exist which can work with netCDF data (e.g. C, FORTRAN, ArcGIS, QGIS, paraview, panoply, Ferret, as well as the deprecated NCL), but on this page we focus on tools commonly used for *analysis* of large scale (tyipcally netCDF) climate data.
