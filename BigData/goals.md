# Working Group Goals

## Ultimate Goal:
**Create a best practices framework for climate-related scientists in Australia working with big/challenging datasets.**

## Definition of big/challenging datasets: 
“Big/challenging/very large data”: when the size and complexity of the dataset is such that “traditional data-processing application software” is inadequate to handle the analysis or management of the dataset ([Wikipedia page for “Big data”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data); [Pangeo FAQ](https://pangeo.io/faq.html))

## Steps to achieve our goal:
- Consolidate a list of software, tools, learning/training modules, relevant documentation, and other resources that currently exist for dealing with, specifically for storing, accessing, and analyzing, big data.
- Identify weak points/missing gaps in existing resources
- Expand documentation, create learning modules, etc. to fill the identified gaps in currently available resources
- Communicate with other working groups (e.g. on data management guidelines) on issues related to improving data organization


### Topics to include in the above steps:
- Methods of data storage (e.g. compression techniques)
- Methods of accessing data and metadata quickly (e.g. `intake` example from Scott)
- Interpreting data format, variables, metadata (e.g. grids, chunking)
- Carrying out computations on large datasets (e.g. using `xarray` and `dask`)
- Identifying which languages/tools are best suited to specific tasks
