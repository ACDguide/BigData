## Pawsey HPC

There are a number of academic HPC systems in Australia outside of those hosted by specific institutions. [Pawsey](https://pawsey.org.au/) in WA hosts a peak HPC machine, local cloud, and data storage. Pawsey is a facility managed by CSIRO. Access to large scale compute quotas is available through the National Computaitonal Merit Allocation Scheme (NCMAS) as with Gadi, as well as a separate Pawsey allocation process which can be accessed more frequently. Currently only limited climate work is being done on the Pawsey peak system but this is likely to increase in the future.

### When would I use this system?

When you need large scale HPC facilities and do not have a dependency on shared reference data, e.g. when running a large scale numeric model and forcing data is either relatively small in size or available online.

### How do I get access?

Director's share applications for limited resources to test the system can be made at any time, and Merit Allocations are available via a competitive process twice a year. See the [support documentation](https://support.pawsey.org.au/documentation/display/US/Getting+Access) for further information.
