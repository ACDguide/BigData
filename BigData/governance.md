# Governance: Working with Big/Challenging Data Collections

The “big data working group” is a group of Australian climate community self-nominated, volunteer representatives. Anyone is welcome to join the group or to contribute independently to the Jupyter Book the group is developing. This document outlines the governance of the big data working group. The group’s goals are described in a [related document](./goals.md). 

## Statement of Scope

The goal of this working group is to create and share a best-practices framework for climate-related scientists in Australia who work with big/challenging datasets. The framework will be collated and shared in the form of a Jupyter Book, made using a public github repository. Contents include:
- Methods of data storage
- Methods of accessing metadata and datasets quickly
- Interpreting data format, variables, and metadata
- Carrying out computations on large datasets
- Computing platforms available to Australian researchers
- Identifying which languages/tools are best suited to specific tasks
- List of resources, such as training material, documentation, etc.

This working group grew out of a workshop “Creating a collaborative approach to climate data” at the Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society’s Annual Conference 2021. There are three other working groups that are closely related:
Creation of a single catalogue and/or access point for climate data
Enabling access of collections across institutions
Dataset management guidelines

## Leadership

There is a chair of the working group, with individual group members leading each of the above listed topics. The group meets once per month, and works collaboratively to organize and create the Jupyter Book.

Membership
- Paige Martin (NASA, formerly ANU) - Chair
- Chloe Mackallah (CSIRO)
- Paola Petrelli (CLEX)
- Claire Trenham (CSIRO)
